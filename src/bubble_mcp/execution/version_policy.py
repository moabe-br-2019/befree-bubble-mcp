"""Where this MCP may write in an app: a branch always, main only when the app has no branch.

Main (``test``) was made read-only after an agent's unreviewed write landed on the team's shared
main (2026-09-25). But an app on a plan without branches has only ``test`` and ``live``, and a
blanket rule left it with nowhere to write at all. So the rule follows the app:

- the app has at least one branch: main is read-only; work goes to a branch - an existing one,
  or a new one made with ``bubble_branch_create`` - and reaches main through a reviewed merge;
- the app has no branch: ``test`` is where development happens, and writing there is allowed;
- ``live`` is never written.

The answer comes from ``/appeditor/get_versions`` (the call ``bubble_branch_list`` makes), cached
per app for a few minutes and dropped when a branch is created or deleted. When the versions
cannot be read, main stays read-only: not knowing is not permission.

Each profile may override this with ``main_write_policy`` in settings.json: ``always`` opens
main, ``never`` closes it, ``auto`` (the default) is the rule above. ``tester_mode`` does not
change it for ordinary writes; the tester tools pass their own narrow exemption to the client.
