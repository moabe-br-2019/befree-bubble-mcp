"""Compact MCP server instructions returned during initialize."""

SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "Use Befree Bubble MCP tools directly; do not inspect repository code or CLI help unless a capability is missing. "
    "Before Bubble work, call bubble_session_check for the profile: when logged_in is false, stop and ask the user "
    "to log in with bubble_session_login - nothing that needs the editor works until then, and tools refuse with "
    "error='session_expired'. "
    "For Bubble work, call bubble_task_runbook with the user's task/profile/context/parent/execute values before "
    "searching tools manually. If setup is incomplete, use bubble_project_bootstrap for profile/app setup and "
    "bubble_session_login for interactive Bubble login when the user can complete the browser flow. Leave "
    "execute=false for previews unless the user explicitly asked to apply changes. bubble_session_check also returns "
    "write_policy: whether main (test) takes writes is set per profile (main_write_policy auto/always/never; "
    "auto = read-only when the app has branches) - write to a branch, or create one with "
    "bubble_branch_create for new work; in an app with only test and live, test takes writes. live is never written. "
    "Use bubble_context_find with "
    "exact=true and include_metadata=false for compact target resolution or verification. Use bubble_readiness_check "
    "before broad work or after installation."
